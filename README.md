# MLOPS_Project
This project implements a complete end-to-end MLOps pipeline using only local, open-source tools. It covers the full lifecycle of a machine learning system — from data ingestion to deployment and monitoring. Key components include DVC for data/version tracking, MLflow for experiment management, Prefect for workflow orchestration, Docker for containerised deployment, FastAPI/Streamlit for local serving, and Evidently AI for monitoring and drift detection. This repository demonstrates how to build a fully reproducible, automated, and production-ready ML workflow on a local machine.
